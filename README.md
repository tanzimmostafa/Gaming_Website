# Gaming-Website

This is just a simple website containing a video of me playing a video game and one of my favourite songs from back then. This is from back when I just started learning HTML and CSS.

I remember the goal being to create a full-fledged website containing the best clips of my gaming videos and cool songs in the videos. The project stopped when I found out that I have to pay to host sites that contain my videos/songs haha.

To open the website, just download all the files and open the .html file in your computer.
