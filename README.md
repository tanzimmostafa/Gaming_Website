# Gaming-Website

This is just a simple website containing a video of me playing a video game and one of my favourite songs from back then. This is from back when I just started learning HTML and CSS.

I remember the goal being to create a full-fledged website containing the best clips of my gaming videos and put cool songs in the videos. The project didn't see light when I found out that I have to pay to host sites that contain my videos/songs of huge sizes haha.

To open the website, just visit the following [Link](https://tanzimmostafa.github.io/Gaming_Website/Gaming-Site/GamingVideo.html).
